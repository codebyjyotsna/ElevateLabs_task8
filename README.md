# Image Compression with K-means Clustering
This project demonstrates how to perform image compression using the K-means clustering algorithm in Python. The notebook provides a step-by-step exploration of reducing the number of unique colors in an image, thereby achieving compression, using unsupervised machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Overview
Image compression is a fundamental application of clustering in machine learning. By grouping similar colors in an image and replacing them with cluster centroids, we can significantly reduce image size while retaining visual quality. This notebook walks through the process of:
- Loading and visualizing an image
- Flattening image data for clustering
- Applying K-means clustering to pixel values
- Reconstructing and visualizing the compressed image with reduced color palette
